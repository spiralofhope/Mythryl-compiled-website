# About

  text -> (magic) -> HTML

This compiled website project is the magic.

It's a unique smart markup language, and other handy stuff.

Or it will be when I rewrite it from Ruby into Mythryl.

# How versions work

Or "what do I download?"

major.minor.revision

'minor' or 'revision' numbers which are EVEN are stable.

'minor' or 'revision' numbers which are ODD are unstable: unfinished,
experimental and generally buggy as hell and I know it.
  - Don't expect these to actually work.  They almost never do!
  - Also, don't expect the most current stuff to actually work.  Until 
    I learn more about branches and other git stuff, I will only be 
    working on the one main branch.  I'll begin tagging things, which 
    should help.

So:

- 1.0.0 is stable.
- 1.0.1 is UNstable.
- 1.1.0 is UNstable.
