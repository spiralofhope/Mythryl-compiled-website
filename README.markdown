The project's website is here:

https://github.com/spiralofhope/mythryl-compiled-website


The project's relevant files are in [the gh-pages tree](https://github.com/spiralofhope/mythryl-compiled-website/tree/gh-pages).

The compiled website engine is what maintains the pages in the
`gh-pages` tree, so it needs access.  Putting everything there was a
simple solution.
