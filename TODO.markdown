In no particular order.

  - Begin two external libraries.
      - Project-specific.
      - Project-nonspecific.
  
  - Figure out test cases / sanity checking for functions.  I haven't found anything specific.

      - http://mythryl.org/pipermail/mythryl/2009-August/000106.html

  - Review and update all items in `scripts/`
  
  - Figure out how I can do test cases with Mythryl.
  
  - Create a syntax cheat sheet, and use that as a todo list.
      - e.g. https://github.com/spiralofhope/mythryl-compiled-website/blob/master/examples/demo.html

  - Create a project logo.  Just 'cause.

  - A templating engine.

  - Determine how I can build everything as individual components which could be run separately (commandline or .. gui?) and are brought together through this project.
