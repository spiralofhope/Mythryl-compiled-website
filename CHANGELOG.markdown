  - File read/write initial experimentation.

  - The OOP experimentation was moved into my `mythryl-random` repository.

  - I got GitHub:pages figured out, so [this project's homepage](http://spiralofhope.github.com/mythryl-compiled-website/index.html) can be there now.

      - Everything had to be moved into the `gh-pages` branch to make this work in the long run.
