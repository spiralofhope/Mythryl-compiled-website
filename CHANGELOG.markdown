  - File read/write initial experimentation.


### 2012-01-07

  - The OOP experimentation was moved into my `mythryl-random` repository.

      - Until I really understand things, and can implement oo functionality with multiple parameters, I will not have that stuff cluttering up this project.

  - I got GitHub:pages figured out, so [this project's homepage](http://spiralofhope.github.com/mythryl-compiled-website/index.html) can be there now.

      - Everything had to be moved into the `gh-pages` branch to make this work in the long run.

  - Empty git repository creation.
